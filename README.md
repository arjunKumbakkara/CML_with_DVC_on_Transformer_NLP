    Main idea of this project is to explain how CML can be implemented in an NLP Project therefore main focus of this Project is to explain how CML can be implemented. We assume that user is well verse in ðŸ¤— Transformers , DVC & Weights&Biases (Wandb) Implementations.

    Below are the online resource used for building this Project.

    - [DVC Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7WG7YrwYcnDBDuCkFbcyjnZQrdskFsBz) and [DVC CML Official Doc](https://cml.dev/doc/self-hosted-runners?tab=AWS)
    - [Official Huggingface Website](https://huggingface.co/docs)
    - [Weights & Biases Official Doc](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/integrations/huggingface)
    - Apart from above from iNeuron's Team Sunny Bhaveen Chandra Session on DVC Helped to complete this project

    Before we begin with the session few things that which need to be setup are as follows:
    - One AWS IAM user with EC2 & S3 Developer Access 
    - S3 Bucket to store the Dataset
    - Second EC2 Spot Instance need to be requested in advance if not done earlier.

    Please follow these online Resource AWS related information

    In this project we want to implement Transformer Classification for [Kaggle Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hassanamin/atis-airlinetravelinformationsystem), idea is to implement DVC so that from DVC studio we can do the experiments, where as in Transformers Weights & Biases have in built implementation which allows to save Best Model's weights & Metrices. 

    We can use DVC for Metric tracking but for that further changes & implementation need to be implemented. On the other hand, Weights & Biases just need minimalist changes in any transformer code to start tracking. One major advantage which I see in using Weights & Biases i.e. it save best model which otherwise we had to do after every experiments.

    Now I believe that we're through with the goal and clear vision as in what we want to do in this project. 

    Lets begin by click and going into this [Template Repository](https://github.com/nabarunbaruaAIML/project-template-with-DVC) 

    Once into Template Repository Please click Button **Use this Template**.

    #Overview:
    ### Why DVC ?
    ![DAG Principle](./Dag.png)


    #### Data processing or ML pipelines typically start a with large raw datasets for most usecases , inclusive of intermediate featurization and training stages .This then finally produces a final tuned model along with the needed accuracy metrics. Versioning of these large data files and directories alone is not sufficient.We also need to understand  How the data is filtered, transformed , enriched (if the case be) , or used to finally train  the ML models? DVC introduces a mechanism to capture and monitor those data pipelines â€” series of data processes that produce a final result (A final state as that of a graph).
    #### DVC pipelines and their data can also be easily versioned (using Git). This allows you to better organize your project, and reproduce your workflow  when and where required and the results can totally ace it!

    ## Now follow below steps for kickstarting the project:

    ### STEP 01- Create local repository after cloning the repository. We can use git bash for cloning if using windows system. If Linux/Mac OS then Terminal will work.

    ### STEP 02- Create a conda environment after opening the repository in VSCODE

    ```bash
    conda create --prefix ./env python=3.7 -y
    ```
    Activate the environment in the VSCode by executing the following command:
    ```bash
    conda activate ./env
    ```
    OR
    ```bash
    source activate ./env
    ```

    ### STEP 03- install the requirements
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    ### STEP 04- initialize the dvc project
    ```bash
    dvc init
    ```

    ### STEP 05- commit and push the changes to the remote repository
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Detailed Commit for further reference"
    git push origin master    # Branch of choice
    ```

    ### STEP 06- Push operation triggers for the Pipeline
    The push operation triggers the entire training pipeline as explained on top provided all required API keys and 
    configurations are in place with the same sequence.




    ### STEP 07- Push as the Github Event: 
    Github listens to Push as an Event by the github workflow .This then starts the pipeline defined in the workflow as can be seen below in the Actions tab

    ![Actions](./Actions.png)
    The configured DVC stages are executed now one after the other in a EC2( Ubuntu 18 OS) configured instance (our case) else if the instance is not configured then github runs these on a spot instance internally and after the completion of the entire pipeline ,it also cleans up the resources utilized leaving us with only the Metrics and Best model saved.

    As mentioned before, the order of execution of stages can be seen below:
    ![ActionSequence](./training_sequence.png)

    Detailed logs of the same can also be found by clicking the step: Now as seen below, the training starts and finishes
    ![ActionSequence](./training.png)

    Logs of custom level (info,debug,error) can also be customized and accessed from the EC2 instance as well if we are using a dedicated instance and not the spot instance of Github.


    ### STEP 08- Experiment Management:
    DVC Studio - [DVC Studio](https://studio.iterative.ai)
    This helps us in ML experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration(While a team of developers work with different sets of experiments).DVC Studio does bookkeeping automatically too. See below: 

    ![DVC Studio ](./dvc_studio.jpeg)

    Since DVC Studio integrates with github smoothly, we can review and cherry pick each commit related to the experiments and this gives a whole lot of flexibility.

    ### STEP 08- Evaluation Metrics Management :
    wandb  -Weights and Biases  [Wandb](https://wandb.ai/site)
    Although, DVC Studio This helps us in ML experiment tracking, visualization, and collaboration and best models if used ,
    Weights and Biases(wandb) makes it even more easier by recording evaluation metrices and providing insights with plots.
